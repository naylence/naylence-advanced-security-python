# Naylence Advanced Security

**Naylence Advanced Security** is a high-assurance extension for the [Naylence Agentic Fabric](https://github.com/naylence) that delivers advanced cryptographic and policy-driven protections for multi-agent systems. It is designed for environments where agents, services, and organizations must interact across trust domains while preserving **confidentiality, integrity, durability, and policy compliance**.

At its core, Naylence already provides a zero-trust, message-oriented backbone for federated agents. This package extends that foundation with **overlay security features** and **pluggable security managers** that make the system resilient in complex, federated, and regulated deployments.

## Key Features

* **Overlay Encryption & Sealed Channels**
  Adds an additional cryptographic layer on top of channel security. Messages remain encrypted and authenticated across multi-hop routes, even if intermediate sentinels or transport layers are compromised.

* **Envelope Signing & Identity Assurance**
  Supports both **key-based signing** and **X.509/SPIFFE-style identities**, ensuring every envelope is verifiable to its origin. This enables tamper-resistant audit trails and fine-grained access control.

* **Security Profiles**
  Predefined profiles (`open`, `perimeter`, `standard`, `strict-overlay`) encapsulate best-practice combinations of authentication, encryption, and authorization. Developers can choose the right trade-off between ease of use and maximum assurance.

* **Pluggable Security Managers**
  The package exposes extension points for `SecurityManagerFactory` and `AuthorizerFactory`. This allows custom implementations of:

  * Shared-secret or OAuth2 authorization
  * Policy-driven security contexts
  * Custom identity backends (PKI, SPIFFE, or bespoke systems)

* **Durable Cross-Domain Trust**
  Enables secure federation across organizations or cloud providers, with guarantees that **policies, not perimeter assumptions**, determine who can talk to whom.

## Why Advanced Security?

Agent orchestration introduces unique risks:

* Messages often cross multiple hops and administrative domains.
* Long-running jobs and sticky sessions can span hours or days.
* Agents may be mobile, ephemeral, or deployed in untrusted environments.

Naylence Advanced Security addresses these challenges by ensuring that **security travels with the message**—not with the network perimeter. This shifts protection closer to the application and agent layer, enabling **zero-trust by design**.

## Use Cases

* **Federated AI Agent Systems** – Secure orchestration across multiple organizations or departments.
* **Cross-Cloud Workflows** – Durable, encrypted communication across cloud providers and trust boundaries.
* **Regulated Environments** – Fine-grained, auditable security controls for healthcare, finance, or defense.
* **Multi-tenant Platforms** – Strong tenant isolation and policy-based routing in agent platforms.
